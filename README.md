# Ketchlip

Inspired by the Udacity cs101 course I put together Ketchlip to scan Twitter for links in my friends tweets. 
Ketchlip then crawl and index links found and makes them searchable through a simple webserver. I'm doing this for fun!


## Dependencies

Ketchlip needs these libraries to be installed:
> pip install 'library name'

* tweepy

* BeautifulSoup
